    <h2> Regency Houses </h2>
    <p> Coming towards the beach in Brightonâ€™s residential areas, west of
      the town center heading towards Hove you will come across the Regency Houses.
      These houses are normally cream with round bay windows and iron balconies.
      The best places to look at these houses Regency Square, Brunswick Terrace,
      Brunswick Square, and the horseshoe-shaped Adelaide Crescent.
      You may also want to stop east of the town center such as Sussex Square,
      Lewes Crescent, and Arundel Terrace.
