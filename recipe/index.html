Classic Homemade Mac and Cheese made with bite-size pasta, cheddar cheese, and a simple creamy sauce all baked to perfection in the oven.  This recipe includes tips, tricks, and photos for making PERFECT baked mac and cheese. <br> </br>

This mac and cheese recipe has many similarities to another of my favorites; One Pan Baked Ziti. They are both creamy, and dreamy, comfort food that gets baked to cheesy, bubbly perfection in the oven. <br> </br>

I’m pretty sure that most adults love a great homemade macaroni and cheese recipe just as much as our kids do! My kids will enjoy a box of Kraft macaroni and day, but everyone gets especially excited when I make this homemade mac and cheese, and for good reason! <br> </br>

This recipe is incredibly easy, and your kids would probably love to help you make it! I let my littles help grate the cheese and measure the noodles.<br> </br>

For me, mac and cheese has to have a smooth and creamy cheese sauce, and I’ve had enough trial and error in this department to understand that there are a few simple things you can do to achieve that smooth sauce we all want in our macaroni! </p>

<h2> HOW TO AVOID GRAINY CHEESE SAUCE: </h2>
<ul>
<li> The type of cheddar makes a difference. High quality aged cheddar cheese will give you a stronger taste and smoother texture. More mild and inexpensive cheddar cheeses will have less flavor and almost a grittier taste.</li>
<li> Use fresh grated cheese. Pre-shredded store-bought cheese will not melt the same as freshly grated cheese, and grating the cheese helps it melt smoothly and evenly in the sauce. </li>
<li> Bring the cheese to room temperature. I like to grate the cheese very first, before moving forward with the recipe. That allows it to sit at room temperature while I prepare the white sauce. </li>
<li> Use low heat. In order for the cheese to melt properly and smoothly we want it to have gradual changes in temperature (like how we shredded it and allowed it to come to room temperature at the beginning of the recipe). When it’s time to add the cheese to the white sauce, remove the sauce from heat and let it cool for a few minutes. It only needs to be warm enough to melt the cheese. </li>
<li> Don’t over-stir the sauce once the cheese has melted. Add the noodles and quickly assemble in pan and put into the oven. </li>

<h2> AVOID PRE-SHREDDED CHEESE! </h2>
<p> I know they are sooo convenient, but not only do pre-shedded cheeses just not taste as great, they are also mixed with various types of powder which prevent them from melting as well as freshly shredded cheese.
So while it’s not life or death, I highly recommend getting out your block grater and shredding fresh cheese for your homemade mac and cheese!  You won’t regret it! </p>

<h2> 8 SIMPLE INGREDIENTS </h2>
<ul>
<li>Elbow macaroni: It’s my favorite for this recipe, but any other bite-sized pasta will work.</li>
<li>Butter: salted or unsalted will work–just adjust the amount of salt you add, depending on the butter.</li>
<li>Flour </li>
<li>Salt </li>
<li>Ground black pepper </li>
<li>Milk </li>
<li>Half and half </li>
<li>Shredded Cheddar cheese: the higher quality aged-cheddar, the better! </li>
</ul>

<h2> PERFECT MAC AND CHEESE IN 5 STEPS: </h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven. Preheat to 325 degrees and lightly grease a square baking dish.</li>
<li>Cook the macaroni. Slightly undercook your noodles (about 1 minute under al-dente). Drain and set aside.</li>
<li>Make the roux.  Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add milk and cheese.  Stir in milk and half and half, slowly, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add 1 cup shredded cheese to the sauce and stir just until melted. Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat them in the sauce.</li>
<li>Pour into baking dish.  Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese over the top. Pour remaining pasta over it and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
